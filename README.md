# Building an Async API with ASP.NET Core
This repository contains the fully functioning finished sample code for my Building an Async API with ASP.NET Core course. 

It contains best practices on how to improve scalability by writing async code, naming guidelines, when it makes sense to use async on the server and when it doesn't, integrating with external services (including working with multiple calls & dealing with cancellation) and a set of common pitfalls to avoid.
